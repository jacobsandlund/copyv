# copyv

Version control for copy paste!

## Usage

When copy pasting code from other repositories, add a comment above the code pointing back to the source and `copyv` can keep your copy pasted code up to date! (Well, that's the idea--right now it only shows a diff of what's been changed from when the code was copied.)

```
